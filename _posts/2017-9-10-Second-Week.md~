What are your expectations of the class?
I expect to come out of this class a better programmer. 
It has been an EXTREMELY unproductive week. Missed 2 oop quiz because of doc's and nosebleed. Oh well. As they say, early bird gets the worm, and I don't like worms.

Spent 2 hours setting up Collatz. Estimate 10 hours of coding to complete this project.

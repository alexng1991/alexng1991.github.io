CS371p Fall 2017: <Alexander Ng>

**What are your expectations of the class?**
I expect to come out of this class a better programmer, through the use of tools for development and a deeper understanding on the rationales of code design. 

**What did you do this past week?**
It has been an EXTREMELY unproductive week. Missed 2 oop quiz because of doc's and nosebleed. Oh well. As they say, early bird gets the worm, and I don't like worms. Spent 2 hours setting up Collatz. Estimate 10 hours of coding to complete this project.

**What's in your way?**
My lack of discipline and love for sleep. I used to think that a cheap laptop would not get in the way of my productivity, how wrong I was. It seems theres always a saying about some profession needing a good tool, like a chef needing a good knife. It feels programming becomes much easier and smoother when I am on my dual monitor high end desktop compared to my 400 dollar egg carton machine, despite the fact I have to do everything through putty on my windows desktop. 

**What will you do next week?**
Start the project. Prepare my resume for career fair. Catch up on all my schoolwork. I think my mind is still stuck in the summer holidays, and it has been jolted back into reality. Some catchup to do for all my classes.

**What's my experience of the class?**
I love the way the professor teaches. The interaction makes it very engaging, and running through working and broken examples made understanding very easy.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Define your goal and work backwards from there. - My Ethical Hacking Professor's

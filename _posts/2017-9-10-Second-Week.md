What are your expectations of the class?
I expect to come out of this class a better programmer, through the use of tools for development and a deeper understanding on the rationales of code design. 

What did you do this past week?
It has been an EXTREMELY unproductive week. Missed 2 oop quiz because of doc's and nosebleed. Oh well. As they say, early bird gets the worm, and I don't like worms. Spent 2 hours setting up Collatz. Estimate 10 hours of coding to complete this project.

What's in your way?
My lack of discipline and love for sleep.

What will you do next week?
Start the project.

What's my experience of the class?
I love the way the professor teaches. The interaction makes it very engaging, and running through working and broken examples made understanding very easy.

What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Define your goal and work backwards from there.
